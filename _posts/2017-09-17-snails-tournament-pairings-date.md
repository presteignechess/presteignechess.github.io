**Entries needed for Friday 22nd September**

I will be making the draw for the first round of our snails chess tournament on Friday night or Saturday morning. So Friday is the last date for entry for round one.

Pairings and results will be published on

Please be warned the url for pairings and results may change when development of the website is completed.
