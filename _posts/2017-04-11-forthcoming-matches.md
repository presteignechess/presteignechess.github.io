Please add these two dates to your diaries:

I have arranged two five-board matches - 

**Tuesday 18th April at home to Hereford Chess Club.**  
7:30pm for a 7:45pm start.


**Tuesday 2nd May away to Ludlow Chess Club**  
(They play at The Feathers Public House SY8 1AA)  
7:30pm for a 7:45pm start.

I will assume that everyone is available unless they let me know otherwise.
