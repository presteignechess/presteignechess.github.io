## Snails 2019 - The Club's First Graded Tournament? ##

##### A five round 'All Play All Tournament' #####
##### Fortnightly at 7.30 p.m. prompt #####

Rounds on 10th and 24th September, 5th and 19th October and 3rd December.

The time control shall be all moves in 1 hour and 25 minutes plus an increment of 10 seconds per move from move 1. 

In January 2020 the English Chess Federation grades will change to a four figure value, comparable with the existing FIDE grades. The new system is designed to be much more responsive to change than the old one. Competitors will be able to get a grade after playing just 5 games in organised tournaments against graded opponents. At the moment only Brian, Chris and Michael are known to have current ECF grades, ( see: <a href="/members.html">member grades</a> ) but even so it should be possible to arrange a second graded tournament before December so that those who have not yet got a grade can get one in the January grading list.

We will be able to use the English Chess Federation's League Management System to enter the results. It is an additional bonus that this will automatically register our club with the ECF and advertise our club on the ECF's website.
