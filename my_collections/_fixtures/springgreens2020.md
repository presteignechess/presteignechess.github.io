## Chess for Everyone ##

##### All Day Saturday and Sunday #####

The Court of Noke is in Staunton on Arrow, four or five miles from Presteigne.

This is an opportunity for us to encourage people of all in a beautiful setting to have a game of chess with friendly people in green and pleasant surroundings. We can have a table, or two in the grounds.
