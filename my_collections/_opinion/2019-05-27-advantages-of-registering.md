Membership of the English Chess Federation entitles you to play in chess tournaments in England and Wales.

If you wish to play in any graded chess tournament in England or Wales the results of your games in the tournament must be graded by either the English Chess Federation (ECF), or the Welsh Chess Union (WCU) if it is in South Wales. For each tournament there is a fee to have the results submitted for grading, unless you are a payed up member of the federation. This fee, of about eight pounds per tournament is soon recouped by the membership fee to the ECF.

The current annual membership fees are £16.00 for bronze membership, and £23.50 for silver membership running from 1st September to 31st August. These fees are set to increase for the next season. Thus if you play in two or three graded tournaments, including interclub matches, it pays to take out bronze or silver membership.

The ECF sponsors and supports chess training for Juniors in England and Wales.
