### Implementation Starting! ###
I am trying the site before all parts of it are fully available. As it is it is better than the old site which is out of date.

I plan to put up a page describing how the club secretary or club members can add events and fixtures, news, and opinion to the site.

I welcome any feedback, particularly any issues with the layout on any particular devices. I have had a lot of difficulty with operating system idiosyncracies and the pgn file used by the homepage. I would particularly welcome any information about faults with the game display on the homepage. (It is supposed to play through a different classic game of chess each day)
